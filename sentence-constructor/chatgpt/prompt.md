### Vocabulary Table
- The table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives.
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use.
- The table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Japanese, Romaji, English.

### Sentence Structure
