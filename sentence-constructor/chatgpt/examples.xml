    - BAD: The vocabulary table did not show the japanese characters, the cells are blank.  Even after prompting it did not include.
    - BAD: The beginner sentences is uncessary, it should just start showing vocabulary table.
    - BAD: In the clues, we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure is too much, we wwant something conceptual like this: [Location][Subject][Verb],[Object][Verb-past]?

    Let's work on translating the sentence into Japanese. Here's a table of vocabulary to get us started:

    | Japanese | Romaji | English        |
    |          |  kuma	| bear           |
    |          | doa	| door           |
    |          | gomi	| garbage        |
    |          | naka	| inside/out     |
    |          | soto	| outside        |
    |          | aru	| to exist       |
    |          | okosu	| to leave       |
    |          | kita	| came           |
    |          | imasu	| to be (polite) |

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We can break it down into two parts:
    Bears are at the door.
    Did you leave the garbage out?
    For the first part, we can use the verb (aru) to indicate existence. For the second part, we can use the verb (okosu) to ask if someone left something.
    
    Here's a possible sentence structure:
    
    [ Bears ] [ are at ] [ the door ]
    [ You ] [ did ] [ leave the garbage ] [ out ]?
    
    Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary table and the sentence structure above?

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
